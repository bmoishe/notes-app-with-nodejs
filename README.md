# Notes App with Node JS

## User Stories:

I have used the User Stories from a previous Makers project (
![Notes App](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/further_javascript/notes_app_user_stories.md ) )

```
As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want
```

```
As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember
```

```
As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note
```
